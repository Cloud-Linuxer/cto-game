# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **cto-game** repository - a new project with no existing codebase yet. The project name suggests it may be a game, simulation, or interactive experience related to CTO (Chief Technology Officer) activities.

## Initial Setup Guidance

Since this is a new repository, consider the following when starting development:

### Technology Stack Decisions
When the user requests initial setup, ask about:
- **Primary language/framework** (e.g., Python/JavaScript/TypeScript, game engine, web framework)
- **Target platform** (web, desktop, mobile, terminal)
- **Game/simulation mechanics** (if applicable)
- **Architecture approach** (monolithic, microservices, client-server)

### Project Structure Recommendations
Once technology choices are made, establish clear directory structure:
- Source code organization
- Asset management (if game-related)
- Test structure
- Configuration files
- Documentation approach

## Development Workflow

### Initial Repository Setup
Currently the repository is empty. When code is added, update this file with:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Development server setup
- Dependency management
- Deployment procedures

### Git Workflow
- Remote: `git@github.com:Cloud-Linuxer/cto-game.git`
- Branch: `main` (currently empty)

## Future Sections to Add

As the project develops, this file should be updated with:
- **Build & Development Commands**: How to run, test, and build
- **Architecture Overview**: High-level system design and component relationships
- **Key Patterns**: Important architectural decisions and coding patterns
- **Integration Points**: External services, APIs, or systems
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing approaches
- **Deployment**: How to deploy and release

**Note**: This is an initial CLAUDE.md for a new project. Update this file as the codebase develops to reflect actual architecture, commands, and development practices.
